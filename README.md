# Selenium_Ollama_Testing_Internship
This internship project focuses on exploratory software testing using Selenium and a local language model The system automates web interaction captures UI state and uses LLM reasoning to assist testing decisions The goal is to study AI assisted exploratory testing rather than fixed test cases.

🔍 AI-Assisted Exploratory Testing using Selenium & Local LLM
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on building an AI-assisted exploratory testing framework using Selenium WebDriver integrated with a local Large Language Model (LLM).
Traditional automation testing relies on predefined test cases, which limits its ability to discover unexpected behaviors. This project aims to go beyond scripted testing by introducing LLM-driven exploratory reasoning, enabling the system to observe application behavior, analyze UI states, and suggest intelligent test actions dynamically.
